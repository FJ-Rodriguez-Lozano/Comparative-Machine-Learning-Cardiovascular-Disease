# Comparative-Machine-Learning-Cardiovascular-Disease
This repository contains additional information from the article entitled "Comparative of Machine Learning methods detecting Cardiovascular Disease". The repository contains the following information organized in folders:

* **attribute-correlations folder**: Information on the pairwise correlation between attributes of the dataset.
* **attribute-histograms folder**: Histogram of the values of each attribute of the dataset.
* **Dataset-10-fold-partitions folder**: Stratified partitions using the 10-folds methodology.
* **Logistic-model-tree folder**: Information of the best model obtained from the comparison. It contains both the tree (in a pdf file) and the logistic regressions of each of the leaves (in a .txt file).
* **metrics-results folder**: Results of the metrics used in the article for each of the algorithms. The information contained in this folder is shown in the form of .pdf figures where each file is the result of a specific metric (accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, and Kappa Score).
* **Friedman-Nemenyi-test-results folder**: Friedman and Nemenyi test results for all metrics.
